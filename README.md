# UNADON
Transformer-based model to predict genome-wide chromosome spatial position

UNADON predicts the genome-wide cytological distance to a specific type of nuclear body measured by TSA-seq using both sequence features and epigenomic signals. The neural network architecture is described in the figure below.
